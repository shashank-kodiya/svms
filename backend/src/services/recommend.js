//   Price        25%  the cheapest center gets full marks; others get cheapest / their price
//   Availability 15%  share of the day's slots that are still free
//   Rating       15%  customer reviews, smoothed so one review can't swing the score (see below)
//   Experience   10%  completed jobs on this platform, full marks at 50
// If there is no distance, the other four weights are scaled up so the score still runs to 100.
